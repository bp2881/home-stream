## Check metadata, first convert it

1) Unsupported media files(.mkv, etc.) muust be handled [use ffmpeg to convert it to mp4, must be done when file is added to folder]
2) Upgrade UI (make home page and then link it to movies)
3) Look for ways to make the streaming fast
4) Add subtitles and multi-language support for videos
